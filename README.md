Welcome to my short Library Project from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website.

To see my project, you first need to edit the MongoDB database in the line 14 of app.js file. Once it's done, you can run #"npm run server" to start the server with Nodemon or just #"npm run start" to start it once. 

You can also populate de database by launching the populate.js file with you database as an argument. 

Have a nice try !
